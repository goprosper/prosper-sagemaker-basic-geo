# Instructions, Sample Data, and Sample Code for Prosper SageMaker Propensity Models (BASIC-GEO)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that includes complete instructions, sample data, and Python code for using Prosper Propensity Models based on the BASIC-GEO feature set. It includes complete examples of using the models for both realtime inference and batch transform jobs.

## Instructions for Installing the Repository on a SageMaker Notebook Instance

1. Create or start an existing SageMaker Notebook Instance.
2. Open Jupyter on your Notebook Instance.
3. From the Jupyter Files tab, create a new terminal by selecting it from the **new** dropdown immediately above the file explorer in the upper right side of the screen.
4. Using the terminal window, switch to the SageMaker subdirectory: 
  
     cd SageMaker  
  
5. Use the following command to clone the repository on the Notebook Instance:  
  
     git clone https://github.com/goprosper/prosper-sagemaker-basic-geo.git  
  
6. Open prosper-sagemaker-basic-geo/using_prosper_model_package_basic_geo.ipynb from the Jupyter File tab.
